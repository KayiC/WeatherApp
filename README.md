# WeatherApp
Your task is to design and prototype a weather app, which is a web-based application that provides an interactive user interface for showing information about current weather and weather forecasts.

There are thousands of weather apps and weather forecasting web pages. Most mobile phones now come with a built-in weather app. You might think that these apps are very simple - they just tell you the weather, after all. However, when you look at them closely you will see that there are a number of complex design questions that need to be answered:

  • Who is the app for?
  • What will they use it for?
  • What is the most important information to show the user?
  • How can my app stand out against the thousands of other apps?
  
A quick survey of existing weather apps will show you that they are designed for a range of users and target activities. For example, some apps are aimed at young users, others are aimed at skiers or climbers, others are aimed at farmers, whilst the majority are aimed at the general population. You will also see that there is a wide range of designs for weather apps: some apps provide a lot of information for many different locations, others provide maps, others have animations and videos, and others have minimal designs focusing on core information elegantly displayed.

The Weather App is required to have basics features which include,
  • Display of essential weather information, including temperature (in Celsius/Fahrenheit), weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.), and location.
  • Capability to retrieve data from the weather API (i.e. Open Weather API) and presenting dynamic changes in weather information within the user interface.
  
The Weather App should incorporate at least one feature that resonates with the specific interests of the user group. The extensions would differ based on your stakeholders and your creativity. Potential extensions include, but are not limited to:
  • Transition animations from day to night.
  • Provision of recommendations tailored to specific weather conditions, such as suggesting the use of an umbrella during rainy predictions or advising preparations for a heatwave.
  • Visualise weather API data in an informative, relevant, and visually engaging manner.
  • Exploration of other innovative possibilities that align with stakeholder interests.
